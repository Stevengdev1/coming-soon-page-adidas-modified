# Coming Soon Landing Page

A small front-end project that demonstrates a responsive “Coming Soon” landing page using HTML and CSS.

This project focuses on layout structure, responsive design, custom fonts, and building a marketing-style page with clear messaging and an email input form for a future product launch.

## Purpose

* This project was built to:
* Practice layout structure for landing pages.
* Work with responsive design using media queries.
* Use custom fonts with @font-face.
* Build a simple email input form.
* Reinforce mobile-first styling principles.

## Features

* “Coming Soon” marketing layout.
* Brand logo displayed at the top of the page.
* Headline and descriptive text for user engagement.
* Email input form for launch notifications.
* Mobile and desktop-specific layouts.
* Custom typography using external font files.
* Responsive imagery for different screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

* CSS3

## How It Works

The page is structured using container elements to control layout and spacing.
* The mobile layout displays a hero image, centered text, and form input.
* Custom fonts are loaded using @font-face.
* CSS handles spacing, typography, and layout.
* A media query adjusts the layout for larger screens:
    * Mobile hero image is hidden.
    * Desktop background and side image are displayed.
    * Typography scales up for larger viewports.

## Styling Notes

* Custom fonts are loaded using @font-face.
